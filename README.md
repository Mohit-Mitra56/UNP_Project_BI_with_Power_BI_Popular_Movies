# UNP_Project_BI_with_Power_BI_Popular_Movies

As part of my internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyse Popular Movies. The dashboard tracks Vital KPIs such as Total movies, Total users, Total Ratings and Total tags & genres, providing valuable insights into Popular tags, Popular Geners over the years, Tag-Relevance and IMBD & TMBD links.
