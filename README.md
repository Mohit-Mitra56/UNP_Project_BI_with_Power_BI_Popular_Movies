# UNP_Project_BI_with_Power_BI_Popular_Movies

As part of my internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyse Popular Movies. The dashboard tracks Vital KPIs such as Total movies, Total users, Total Ratings and Total tags & genres, providing valuable insights into Popular tags, Popular Geners over the years, Tag-Relevance and IMBD & TMBD links.

- *Track trends over time:* Analyze movie releases, ratings, and revenue across years and decades.  
- *Compare genres:* Explore popularity, ratings, and box office performance side by side.  
- *Analyze ratings & reviews:* Investigate rating distributions
- *Visualize data:* Use charts, graphs, and maps to uncover patterns.  
- *Gain insights:* Make data-driven decisions for production, distribution, and marketing.  

Ideal for film enthusiasts, industry professionals, and researchers, this dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the movie industry.
